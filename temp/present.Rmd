## Motivation 

- Individuals with higher Socioeconomic Status (SES) tend to display better health outcomes

- Correlational relationship well established in literature but (causal) mechanisms are 
hard to investigate due to endogeneity and long-term development (multiple generations)

- Deaton (2003) exposes a few hypotheses

  - Education: with access to better education -> better health decisions
  - Irrationality: Too high discount rate -> failure to build capital & protect health
  - Absolute vs relative  "income hypothesis” -> Evidence that not only level of wealth but also
  _ranking_, i.e, inequality, affect health outcomes


## Data 

- Cross-sectional SOEPv36 data from 2019 with 24.429 observations, including new sample on
top-stakeholders (TS)

- Wealth module from 2017 for other samples

- Item non-response imputed via Bayesian Networks implemented by Göbler (2019)

- Drawback: Health module (from 2018) with broader coverage of health variables not available for
SOEP TS sample

## Outlook 

### Objectives

- Generate via Principal Components a physical, a mental and (possibly) a _social health_ variables
to consolidate available health information in fewer dimensions

- Investigate which variables more strongly predict health outcomes in these dimensions

- investigate how predictive are the physical and mental health variables on income and wealth
outcomes. 

### Challenges 

- Properly deal with endogeneity, confounder and collider biases!
- Still need to consolidate a overall research question.
