Abstract

It is a long-established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
when looking at its layout. The point of using that is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
of letters, as opposed to using ‚ÄôContent here, content here‚Äô, making it look like readable English.
Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use that as their default model text,
and a search for ‚Äôlorem ipsum‚Äô will uncover many websites still in their infancy. Various versions
have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humor and
the like).

4 Empirical Methodology and Main Results

4.1 Measuring Health
Since 2002, as part of the health module in the individual questionnaire, SOEP includes questions
modeled on the 12-item Short Form Health Survey version 2 (SF-12). Based on these questions,
SOEP provides the Physical (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) scales, as described in Andersen et al. (2007).
The SF-12 methodology prescribes both the formulation of the questionnaire and the computation to construct the scales (see Ware et al. (2002) as cited in Andersen et al. (2007))
For my main analysis, I use the input variables as provided by SOEP but instead of conducting
a
To create mental and physical health scores for individuals in our sample I follow a similar
procedure as described by Andersen et al. (ibid.), on which the health scores provided by SOEP
are based. The procedure I follow differs from the SOEP‚Äôs implementation in two important
aspects.
Firstly, I conduct an oblique rotation to allow for correlation between the factors. By forcing an
orthogonal rotation, as is the case in when extracting the principal components, one maximizes
the variance accounted for each component. One crucial restriction is that uncorrelated factors
must be assumed (Gorsuch, 2015, p. 199).
Secondly, I plug all variables into the factor model instead of working with the mean values of
each subscale. With that, I can increase the confidence on the validity of each question by checking
that variables belonging to the same category are indeed closely clustered. The generated scores,
however, are highly correlated regardless of the rotation method chosen.
In Table 4.1, I present in detail the input data to the factor model, including the question
wording in the questionnaire and transformations applied to them.
test
Child (2006) suggested removing those items which have communality value less than 0.20 in
the dimension reduction technique. Low commonality value of an item represents a poor ratio of
its unique variance to its shared variance. This indicates such an item could not contribute to
explaining the construct adequately. You can read the article by Peter Samuels (2017) for further
understanding.

Factor loadings comparison between SF-12 and alternative methods

Note: The graphs show in both versions that the variables are meaningfully clustered in their respective group and
the clusters are well separated. However, allowing for an oblique rotation results in a clearer factor separation. The
loadings of each variable are closer to one of the axes, indicating that a variable strongly affects one but not the
other factor. Further, by using all variables instead of the mean of grouped variables in the alternative model we
can confirm that variables from the same category are indeed closely clustered. One drawback with the alternative
model is that vt (Vitality) is only weakly loaded from both factors.

4 Empirical Methodology and Main Results

4.2 Diff in Diff
In the main analysis, the goal is to estimate the dynamics of wealth which can be attributed
to significant health degradation in the physical and mental domain. For that, I apply the
Differences-in-Differences estimator for staggered treatment adoption designs as introduced by
Callaway and Sant‚ÄôAnna (2021). This approach incorporates the recent discussions on the issues
faced by commonly used Two-Way Fixed-Effects (TWFE) estimator for similar research settings.
Specifically, this approach is robust to the ‚Äúforbidden comparisons‚Äù issue, term coined and explained in Borusyak et al. (2024, p. 14). For an overview on the recent methods that do not impose
strict assumptions on treatment homogeneity, refer to the extensive survey from de Chaisemartin
and D‚ÄôHaultfoeuille (2022).
4.2.1 Diff-in-Diff Design From CS
The estimator proposed in Callaway and Sant‚ÄôAnna (2021), avoids these ‚Äúforbidden comparisons‚Äù.
In short, the CS estimator can be divided into two steps. First, compute the differences of valid
comparison groups in several simple, balanced 2-periods by 2-groups DiD designs. Then, aggregate
these estimations in a meaningful way. Adapting the notation of Eq. 2.8 from (ibid.), the groups
in the first step can be defined by their respective treatment period ùëî and the measurement time
ùë°. So each ùê¥ùëá ùëá (ùëî, ùë°) is defined as
ùê¥ùëá ùëá (ùëî, ùë°) = ùîº [ùëåùë° ‚àí ùëåùëî‚àí1 |ùê∫ùëî = 1] ‚àí ùîº [ùëåùë° ‚àí ùëåùëî‚àí1 |ùê∂ = 1],

(4.1)

where the conditional term ùê∫ùëî = 1 identifies the group first treated at period ùëî and ùê∂ = 1
determines the control units.1 This is the group-time average treatment effect, as coined by Callaway
and Sant‚ÄôAnna (ibid.).
Concretely, ùë° = {2002, 2004, ..., 2020} and ùëî ‚àà ùí¢, where ùí¢ = {2004, 2006, ..., 2020}. Note that
although we have data from 2002 onward, the always-treated group, that is, those treated in 2002
or those that are treated in their first survey year are dropped from the analysis. Note also that,
to avoid confusion, the subscript ùëî ‚àí 1 in Eq. (4.1) identifies the previous period, which in the
current setting means two years prior, due to the bi-yearly data structure.
Since each one of these groups is by construction, a canonical DiD design, they are valid
comparisons and do not suffer from the ‚Äúnegative weights‚Äù issue.
In the second step, the Callaway and Sant‚ÄôAnna (ibid.) propose different ways of aggregating
the ùê¥ùëá ùëá (ùëî, ùë°)‚Ä≤ ùë†. In the main analysis, I follow the event study type of specification. For that, a
relative-time variable ùëí = ùë° ‚àí ùëî is defined, which identifies time elapsed since treatment adoption.
The target parameter is
ùúÉùëíùë† (ùëí) = ‚àë ùüô[ùëî + ùëí ‚â§ ùíØ]ùëÉ (ùê∫ = ùëî|ùê∫ + ùëí ‚â§ ùíØ)ùê¥ùëá ùëá (ùëî, ùëî + ùëí),

(4.2)

ùëî‚ààùí¢

where ùíØ is 2020 in this analysis. The two new terms in the above summation are, first, the
1

Note that the authors introduce two approaches that differs in terms of control units. One uses never-treated
only, while the other uses also not-yet-treated units as control. I focus here on the never-treated specification,
which is used in the main analysis, due to the risk of anticipation effects biasing the results.

10

4 Empirical Methodology and Main Results
indicator function that restricts the group-time average treatment effects. And second, the term
ùëÉ (.) are the group weights, so that the summation produces an average - weighted by group size
- of all ùê¥ùëá ùëá (ùëî, ùë°)‚Äôs included in the aggregation.
Note that this aggregation may suffer from compositional changes which will have important
implications, which are explained thoroughly in Callaway and Sant‚ÄôAnna (2021, see Equation 3.5).
In short, the authors show that there are two approaches to handling it. Either restricting the
analysis balanced sample or, alternatively, relying on the additional assumption that the effects
are equal across groups. That is, ùê¥ùëá ùëá (ùëî, ùëî + ùëí) does not vary with ùëî for any ùëí ‚â• 0. In the main
analysis, I make the equal-effects assumption, but robustness checks with sample restrictions do
not change the results considerably.
Now concretely, in the main analysis, the relative time window is ùëí = {‚àí10, ‚àí8, ..., 10, 12} years,
for outside this range estimates get very imprecise. The time of treatment is when ùëí = 0 and the
base or reference period, which is the last period before treatment, is when ùëí = ‚àí2.
After computing the ùê¥ùëá ùëá (ùëî, ùë°)‚Äôs, there are a few choices of overall aggregation to obtain a
single parameter estimating the effect being assigned to treatment. As proposed by Callaway and
Sant‚ÄôAnna (ibid., Section 3.2), an intuitive one would be
ÃÖ
ùúÉùë†ùëñùëöùëùùëôùëí
=

ùíØ
1
‚àë ‚àë ùüô[ùë° ‚â• ùëî]ùê¥ùëá ùëá (ùëî, ùë°)ùëÉ (ùê∫ = ùëî|ùê∫ ‚â§ ùíØ),
ùëò ùëî‚ààùí¢ ùë°=2004

where ùëò = ‚àëùëî‚ààùí¢ ‚àëùë°=2004 ùüô[ùë° ‚â• ùëî]ùê¥ùëá ùëá (ùëî, ùë°)ùëÉ (ùê∫ = ùëî|ùê∫ ‚â§ ùíØ). Another aggregation target proposed is relevant for the event-study structure applied here. We can obtain an overall treatment
effect by averaging ùúÉùëíùë† (ùëí) over all event times, as in
ÃÖ =

Main results figure

Notes: This figure depicts the dynamic average treatment on the treated (ATT) of physical (in blue) and mental
health (in red) deterioration on different measures and transformations of wealth. Whiskers depict the 95%
confidence interval. All wealth variables are winsored (at 1st and 99th percentiles). In some specifications the
effect on PCS is similar to that of MCS, while in others there is considerable divergence in terms of persistency
and in the pre-treatment ATT‚Äôs . In most specifications the pre-treatment estimated ATT‚Äôs do show some trend
in means, but their confidence intervals in nearly all cases still include 0. A priori, it is to be expected that the
transformed versions would better hold the parallel trend assumption. That is, the increase in wealth among
different groups is parallels in relative terms, proportional to their wealth in previous period, whereas in absolute
terms, it is less likely that people with different starting wealth follow a parallel wealth accumulation path. The
time window is restricted to 10 periods before and 12 after treatment due to drastic decrease in statistical
precision (widening of CI) outside this range. T-2 is the relative time of treatment and t0 is the first period after
treatment. This panels is a visual representation of the 8 models as displayed in Table 4.2. Panel (a: left) depicts

Notes: Table of results depict the coeÔ¨Äicients of C&S diff-in-diff estimation aggregated in a event-study structure. Tm
are the periods before treatment and Tp are those concurrent to or after treatment. The last period before treatment,
the base level ùëá ùëö2, is not estimated. ùëá ùëù0 is the concurrent, on impact effect. SimpleATT depicts the average of all
ATT(g,t)‚Äôs weighted by group size, as explained in Eq. 3.10 from Callaway and Sant‚ÄôAnna, 2021. Pre_avg and Post_avg
are the average pre and post-treatment effects with respective equal weights for each relative time ùë° . In most specifications pre-treatment ATT is not statistically different to zero, while post-treatment effects are. In most models, the
pre-treatment ATT‚Äôs are not statistically significantly different to 0, apart from the last period before treatment (Tm4)
in model (3), (4) and (6) Standard error in parenthesis, estimated with multiplicative WildBootstrap procedure with 999
repetitions, clustered at the individual level. Using doubly-robust estimation method. Using never treated as control
group to avoid bias due to anticipation effects. long2. * ùëù < 0.05, ** ùëù < 0.01, *** ùëù < 0.001
