\chapter{Introduction}

\vspace{60pt}

``The first wealth is health.'' \quad In 1860, the philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson posited that good health is
a precondition to flourishment and living a fulfilling life.  Since then, researchers have shown that people with higher socioeconomic status live healthier and longer lives (see \cite{deaton2003health,case.deaton2005broken,chetty.etal2016association}). %
%

While these results replicate across diverse societies and periods, the exact mechanisms are still open to
discussion. To what extent wealth causes health or, conversely, health causes wealth is not trivial to disentangle
given the nature of these variables. In a meta-analysis, \citeauthor{kröger.etal2015what} find evidence in both
directions \autocite{kröger.etal2015what}. It is not difficult to think of possible mechanisms. People with higher
socioeconomic status might, for example, have access to better health care or live in areas with more opportunities for following healthier life styles. On the other hand, good health might be a prerequisite for achieving
financial success, as it enables individuals to participate fully in the workforce and pursue educational and career
opportunities. Despite these broad associations, the specific pathways through which health influences wealth
accumulation remain complex. This study aims to contribute to this discussion by focusing specifically on the
pathway from health to wealth accumulation, quantifying how adverse health outcomes impact individuals' wealth
trajectories over time. Further, by analyzing mental and physical health shocks separately, the effects from
both domains can be compared to one another. 


\cref{fig:wealthbyageovertreated} serves to illustrate the difference in wealth trajectory over the life cycle
between two groups: those who experience a significant adverse health outcome over the life cycle, and those who do
not. Although the starting values, on average, are on the same level earlier in life, one group manages to build up
considerably more wealth than the other. By age 60, the group with a more stable health
trajectory accumulates 35\% (gross) and 40\% (net) more wealth than their counterpart.
This work aims to explore if, and to what extent, an adverse health outcome, whether in the mental or physical
domain, helps explain the observed difference in this figure.


On these accounts, this analysis employs a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) method with multiple time periods and
variation in treatment timing to estimate the causal effect of an adverse health outcome on the wealth trajectory
of adults in Germany. The unbalanced panel data employed in this work are provided by the German Socio-Economic
Panel (SOEP). The final sample encompasses people aged between 18 and 75 and provides, among other variables, health and wealth 
information since 2002. It includes over 16 thousand individuals and more than 80 thousand observations.


This work is structured as follows: \cref{sec:overview_did} presents an overview of the DiD framework proposed by
\textcite{cs2021did_mtp}. \cref{chap:data} describes the data and focal variables used in this study.
\cref{sec:meas_health} focuses on the measurement of health and, as a secondary analysis, evaluates some of the
criticisms raised in the literature about uncorrelated health summary scores. Further, the alternative method for
computing the summary scores used in this analysis is introduced. \cref{chap:empir_metho_res} covers the empirical
approach and focuses on the results obtained in the main analysis. Also in this chapter, secondary analyses are
presented. They explore wealth accumulation links and evaluate effect heterogeneity by education attainment and age
groups, as well as a section on robustness checks. \cref{ch:discus} presents a discussion on the obtained results,
including a section on threat to internal validity and another on extensions to the current study. Finally,
\cref{ch:conclus} summarizes the findings in this study.

\chapter{Data}
\label{chap:data}

In this section, I first describe the data source and highlight the focal variables. Subsequently, I outline the working sample and present descriptive statistics, focusing on the group differences across treatment status.

\section{The Socio-Economic Panel}
\label{sec:soep}

This analysis is based on the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), a survey of individuals and households in Germany conducted yearly since 1984 (\cite{goebel.etal2019SOEP}, \cite{liebig.etal2022SOEP}). The two main components for the current study are the modules screening health indicators 
and the one wealth at the individual level.  


\subsubsection{Health variables} In 2002, the health module was revised and since then it has been conducted every
second year (\cite{grabka2022healthv37}). The items in this module target whether the respondent's daily activities
are impaired due to physical or mental health related issues, as well as a subjective assessment on their current
health. An overview on the questionnaire is presente in \cref{tab:health_fact_varname_and_questions}. This resource
also provides detailed information on the resulting variables and conducted transformations before using them in
the factor model. In addition, the distribution of each variable is also presented in
\cref{fig:main_multifig_phys}.
 
From these variables, I compute alternative Physical and Mental Component Summary scores, PCS and MCS,
respectively. An in depth explanation on these constructs is presented in \cref{sec:meas_health}. These summary
scores are the key variables in this work. They are used to assess the individual's health trajectory and to
determine their treatment status.


\subsubsection{Wealth variables}

The wealth module is also available since 2002, but conducted less frequently, namely in 2002, 2005, 2012, 2017 and
2019. %
The focal variables are overall gross wealth and overall net wealth as covered in the \textit{personal assets and
    liabilities} section of the individual questionnaire. It covers real state assets and debts, savings and
investments, building loan contracts, financial assets, tangible assets, and consumer debt. In 2017, two categories
covering automotive and educational loans were added. These items, however, are not included in this analysis in
order to maintain a consistent scope over the whole period. Furthermore, the wealth measures were deflated to 2020
values by the CPI index provided by Germany's \textcite{destatiscpi}. 


Since the wealth and health modules are conducted in different years, I apply a linear interpolation to the wealth
variables in order have wealth measures matching the frequency of the health module. To illustrate, if a
participant has valid wealth information in, say, years 2002, 2007 and 2012, I assume that any variation in
wealth behaves linearly within the sub-ranges. The years with valid information can be considered fixed
\textit{knots} in this exercise. With that, I impute values for 2004 and 2006, as well as 2008 and 2010, such that
it varies linearly between 2002--2007 and, likely with a different change rate, between 2007--2012. I refrain
from doing extrapolations, with the exception of 2020, in which year the values are taken from 2019.  The
assumption is that wealth measures do not vary too drastically within one year. That implies that people with
only one completed wealth module are not included in this analysis. In conclusion, the resulting data comprise
10 waves from 2002 to 2020 with a two-year frequency.

\subsubsection{Further variables of interest} In secondary analyses, I use variables related to the labor market,
such as annual labor earnings, current employment status, as well as full-time experience and unemployment
experience since entering the labor market. These variables are used to evaluate possible wealth accumulation
channels.

Furthermore, variables on subjective well-being are also used in secondary analyses. These include satisfaction
with health, work, income, and life overall.

In addtition, variables covering concrete health diagnoses that can be clearly mapped onto physical or mental
health are also employed. These assess whether the respondent has ever been diagnosed with back pain, heart
conditions, depression, or sleep disorder.

Note that these items are only asked from 2009 onward, so the assumption is made that, prior to 2009, people were
not diagnosed with any of these health conditions. This is arguably a strong assumption but is somewhat remedied by
the question formulation, which asks if the respondent has ``ever'' been diagnosed with X. In a more detailed
analysis, however, those that stated yes should have been dropped from the analysis, since the timing would be
unclear. This was not done here, however, with the implicit assumption that the diagnosis happened on that very
year.

In addition, personal characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, federal state of residence, and years of
education are used as covariates in the main analyses. These variables are employed in the $DiD_{DR}$ framework to
compute the inverse probabilities of treatment. The workings of this procedure are explored in more detail in
\cref{sec:overview_did}. Regarding age, a restricted cubic spline with five equally spaced knots is employed to
better capture nonlinearities in the health and wealth trajectories over the life cycle. To conclude, the
covariates used in the main estimation specification are gender, age spline, federal state residence, legal
disability, marital status, and years of education.


\section{Final Working Sample}

From the health module, the data consist of 240,770 observations with valid PCS and MCS scores. Out of these,
167,567 can be merged with valid observations from the wealth modules. After restricting to those with valid
information on the variables of interest (described above), there remain 163,938 observations.


Finally, I restrict the sample to adults aged between 18 and 75. The age restriction is done so that the models can
still capture the effect of an adverse event happening around the retirement age, and how it evolves into the early
retirement years. Those older than 75 years, however, it is likely to display a distinct (dis)accumulation pattern,
which would likely be better captured by separate evaluations. Finally, after the merging process, it is required
by the DiD framework that each individual has valid data in at least two periods. Those with only one valid
observation dropped from the analysis.


With that, the final sample consists of 141,337 observations. A few considerations are necessary, though. First,
the always-treated units are dropped from the estimation. Those account for 7,866 observations in the physical and
8,395 in the mental domain. Further, each of the 2 by 2 DiD calculations is performed with balanced observations
for that specific calculation. More details are presented in \cref{sec:overview_did}, but as a brief illustration,
in order to compute a single ATT, say, in 2010 for the group treated in 2004, only those individuals present in
2004 and in 2010 can be used. The final number of unique and total observations ultimately used in the estimations
are presented in the table of results for each specification.

\subsection{Descriptive Statistics}

\cref{tab:tableone} presents statistics comparing the eventually-treated and never-treated groups in the physical
and mental domains. In both cases, the data refer to the information from the first survey year of each respondent.

When comparing the physical and mental domains, one can observe that the groups exhibit greater similarity in the
mental health domain. For instance, the difference in starting values of net wealth in the mental domain is only
around 13 thousand, whereas in the physical domain, it differs by about 27 thousand. Similarly, the number of
months in unemployment differs by around 2.5 in the physical domain, whereas in the mental domain, it only differs
by around 1.5.

Interestingly, the MCS value in the mental health domain, which is the variable used in the treatment assignment
rule, is one of the few that does not show a statistically significant difference between the eventually-treated
and never-treated groups. This indicates that when first entering the SOEP, the eventually-treated individuals are
not significantly dissimilar from the never-treated group to start with. This might be one reason why, as later
shown, the models in the mental health domain are more supportive of the parallel trends assumption. It is worth
emphasizing that the data correspond to that apt to be using the estimation procedure. This means that the
always-treated units are discarded. If those would be considered, the differences would be much larger, specially
at the respective first survey year.


With a large number of observations as in this case, even small deviations from the mean across subgroups would
render them to be statistically different to a high confidence level. To assess how the groups differ over the
entire distribution, a univariate kernel density estimation, is presented in \cref{fig:univkerndens}. Restricting
the data to the first survey year of each participant, we observe that the groups, divided by never- and
eventually-treated, are not too dissimilar, as the test statistics in \cref{tab:tableone} would suggest. Focusing
on the selected variables Age, Gross, and Net Wealth, we see well-overlapping support in both health domains, while
in the mental case, the distributions among treated and untreated are more similar.

In this context, I also conduct a logistic regression of \textit{eventually-treated} on the same covariates as in
the main analysis. This aims to estimate the probability of being (eventually) treated, conditioned on  gender, age
spline, federal state residence, legal disability, marital status, and years of education.  The goal is to better
asses if there is enough overlap in the key variables used in the estimations. 

A Common overlap is one of the assumptions of the doubly-robust specification of \textcite[see Assumption 6,
``Overlap condition'']{cs2021did_mtp}. The results, as shown in
\cref{sfig:kd_pi_mcs_main_pcs_main,sfig:kd_pi_mcs_main_mcs_main}, corroborate this assumption. Over the whole
probability range (0--1)  both groups either display considerable density or, at the extremes, is very thinly
populated. There are no areas where the treatment probability of one group is densely estimated and the other is
not. In the mental domain, again, the densities are more similar to one another when compared to the results
from the physical domain.

Note that the resulting estimated probabilities, or their inverse, are not the same set of weights used in the
$\text{DID}_{DR}$ framework. In this exercise, only a single probability of eventual treatment is estimated. In the
$\text{DiD}_{DR}$, in contrast, the estimation targets the probability of being first treated at time $g$. With
that, several values for each individual are computed and used in each of respective 2x2 blocks. This exercise,
however, serves to enhance the credibility that the overlap condition would also be met within the estimation of
each block.

\chapter{Discussion}
\label{ch:discus}

The interactions between health and wealth are complex. Both variables evolve gradually over the life cycle and
their interdependence is not trivial to disentangle. In this study, I focus on the proposition that health causes
wealth. There are several plausible mechanisms, through which this premise would prove to be true. A health shock
can have, for example, a direct impact on one's wealth through expenses to cover the medical costs. In addition,
such a shock, can impair one's labor capacity to a lesser or greater extent. The ability to pursue career and
educational objectives can also be impaired by a unstable health trajectory. These examples illustrate how a health
shock can lead to a different wealth accumulation trajectory over the long run.

Conversely, it is also easy to think of mechanisms where wealth causes health. While
\textcite{meer.etal2003exploring}, via an instrumental variable approach, find evidence of a negligible effect in
the short run, over a longer time span, it is credible that wealthier people could be able to achieve a better
health status through access to better health care, or make preferable lifestyle choices due to easier access to
health-promoting  activities, to name a few. In addition, there are a set of factors, which might be unobserved by
the researcher, that show a causal pathway to both health and wealth. A behavioral or genetic trait might be the
cause of, for example, being better equipped to attain higher education and, thus, accumulate more wealth while, at
the same time, avoid unhealthy behaviors such as alcohol abuse or cigarettes consumption. On these accounts, I
present in the following section key threats to the internal validity of this work.

\section{Threats to Internal Validity}

The framework used in this study accounts for the issue of unobserved factors, by differencing out the outcome of
the same individual over different points in time. Assuming these characteristics remain constant, these hidden
factors cancel themselves out. With that, the obtained coefficients are valid causal estimates of the effect even
in the presence of heterogeneity that, in a cross-sectional setting, would only grant a correlational
interpretation.

A stronger threat to internal validity in this setting, emerges when the researcher subscribes only to the
\textit{social causation} hypothesis, which states that health is caused by, but does not cause wealth. In this
setting, they could argue that those that are eventually treated are different from the non-treated in such key
aspects, that regardless of experiencing an adverse health outcome, their wealth trajectory would not follow a
parallel line to the path of those with more stable health. Differently to the hidden factors case, the applied
framework does not mechanically account for reverse-causation, as implied by the social causation hypothesis. If
this premise truly represents the underlying mechanism, the results obtained would remain the same. Only our
interpretation and their implications would be wrong.

To address this concern, in the availability of several pre-treatment periods, by evaluating their patterns, 
the researcher can adjust their beliefs on the veracity of such hypotheses.  

In this concrete case, the pre-treatment trends show, as covered in depth in \cref{sec:Results}, mixed results. In
some specifications, the pre-trends being close to 0 indicates no difference in the outcome changes across treated
and untreated groups previous to treatment event. Furthermore, the kink observed around the treatment event,
corroborates to the hypothesis that the adverse health outcome does impact the wealth accumulation. With that said,
the confidence intervals over the pre-treatment periods are large in some specifications. With that, one could
argue that the pre-treatment tests do not have enough power to rule out the hypothesis of a diverting pre-treatment
trends. In some cases, such as the physical health shock on unemployment experience (see \cref{sfig:c_expue_main}),
this is indeed the most credible interpretation.  With this in mind, the work of \textcite{rambachan.roth2023more},
where they propose a flexible specification of the pre-trend tests, could prove to find an interesting application
in this setting.

While this discussion may appear to be a solely philosophical consideration, the distinction has clear real life
implications.  If a society, for example, finds it to be unfair that people experience high socioeconomic
disparities at later stages of life and policy makers wish to remedy that, one interpretation would grant more room
for policy instruments to be used than the other. Precisely, the causal interpretation implies that a policy aiming
to minimize severe health variation for the working-age population would have the additional benefit of reducing
wealth inequality at retirement age, as an example. If the correlation interpretation is taken, the policy would
have to act directly on reducing wealth inequality at retirement in order to achieve its goals.


To conclude, the specifications in the mental health domain shows better support for a causal identification,
specially in the primary models with log of gross wealth as the response variable.  One could, therefore,
hypothesize that there is a higher degree of exogeneity in the mental than in the physical dimension. It appears
plausible, a priori, that in the physical domain, the health deterioration happens gradually and, therefore, can be
anticipated in terms of reduced working hours or earlier retirement. And this would lead to a lower wealth build-up
over time. Similarly, it also seems credible that a portion of mental health deterioration happens unexpectedly
and, therefore, cannot be fully anticipated. If that is true, this would explain the difference in pre-trend
pattern when comparing both health domains and why the mental health specifications portray a more credible causal
interpretation.

\section{Extensions and Outlook}
\label{extensions}

In this section, I list a few conceivable extensions to this study in terms of its content as well as concerning
its technical nature. Contentwise, one could enlarge this study's scope by including the partner's and household
data. This could prove to be a significant gain by capturing wealth patterns within a household. The current
setting focuses solely on the individual wealth trajectory.

Another improvement could be achieved by including family history data, in order to capture characteristics
inheritable from parents. This could include socioeconomic variables such as the father's and the mother's
educational attainment. In addition, received inheritance could be a proxy of parent's wealth. In the health
dimension, the parent's age of decease could be a proxy for their health, which would function as genetic proxy.
These variables would capture an inter-generational dimension that focusing solely on the individual trajectory
neglects. Preliminary checks have shown, however, that while these items are asked by the SOEP, the data availability
is rather sparse. The options would be focusing on the subset with valid data or imputing the missing values in
order to use most of the otherwise available information.

The current study can also be extended in a technical way. A matching estimator, for example, that assures balanced
groups prior to treatment, based on a rich set of covariates provided by the SOEP, would ensure that the treated
and control units are indeed very similar to one another. If the results are similar, this procedure would increase
the credibility of causal identification. In the current setting, however, a considerable threat to validity is the
possibility of differential trends due to different levels of wealth between groups in the pre-treatment period.
\textcite{daw.hatfield2018matching} show the risks introducing \textit{regression to the mean} bias by matching on
variables that are correlated with the response variable, including, clearly, the response variable itself.

In addition, \textcite{rambachan.roth2023more} propose an extension to DiD designs where the parallel trends
assumption might be violated. By not restricting the trends between groups to be perfectly parallel, the
authors present novel tools for inference over the bounds of the causal effect, relative to the extent of the
difference in trends, justified by the observed pre-treatment trend.


To conclude, in the current setting, the health summary scales, which are continuous variables, are dichotomized
into a binary treatment variable, as is required by the applied DiD framework. Recent addition to the
literature, however, generalizes this approach to a framework with continuous variables (see
\cite{callaway.etal2024eventstudies}). The possible improvement is two-fold: First, it removes the
discretionary decision of the treatment rule threshold and, second, it is able to distinguish effect intensities. 



\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclus}

In this study, I assess the impact of an adverse health outcome on wealth accumulation over a substantial time
span. By dissecting the analysis into mental and physical health dimensions, I explore variations in effects
across these domains. The investigation encompasses ten bi-yearly waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel,
spanning from 2002 to 2020, and addresses the wealth accumulation trajectories of individuals aged between 18
and 75 years old. Concentrating on primary specifications that measure gross wealth in relative terms, the key
findings can be summarized as follows:

An adverse health outcome in the physical domain reduces the gross wealth accumulation by $6.5\%$,
and reaches $12\%$ twelve years after the event. %
%
In the mental health domain, the effect averages at $8.3\%$ less gross wealth than what is accumulated by the
control group. Twelve years after the event, it accounts for $15\%$ reduced wealth accumulation.

In exploring possible effect channels, I show that the increase in unemployment after the adverse health 
event, measured by unemployment experience, employment status or lack of full-time employment experience,
plausibly demonstrate the effect mechanisms. 

Furthermore, I find no clear evidence on effect heterogeneity by education attainment on  wealth
accumulation directly, although, in terms of unemployment experience---specially in the mental domain---the less
educated are capturing the majority of the effect.

When analyzing by age groups, there are hints of effect heterogeneity on wealth accumulation, with the younger
population (18--39) experiencing a stronger impact. The difference among groups is bigger in the mental
domain. The effect on unemployment experience, in contrast, is stronger for those aged between 40 and 55.


In a secondary analysis, I confirm that the items from SOEP's health module, which are based on the SF-12v2
methodology, captures the intended concepts. The items, as one would expect, are well clustered in the factor space
and a clear separation between physical and mental health dimensions emerges. However, I could also reproduce some
of the raised criticisms on the \textit{agreement problem} between sub-scales and their respective summary scores,
when using the SF-12 with SOEP data. On this account, an alternative exploratory factor analysis model followed by
an oblique rotation is adopted to construct the summary scores used in the main analysis.

Conceivable extensions to this work include integrating partner's information to better account for within-household wealth
structures. In addition, family-related data such as parent's health and proxies for socioeconomic status such
as education attainment could prove to be key explanatory factors to the individual's wealth accumulation
trajectory.
