\section{Doubly Robust Estimator}
\label{app:drdeep}

In this section, for completeness, I present the $\widehat{A T T}_{d r}(g, t)$ as 
described in \textcite[Section 4]{cs2021did_mtp}. Only the equations for the never-treated 
design is presented here, as this was the one used in the main analysis. Further, since
in the main analysis I do not adjust for anticipation, the version presented here
is also simplified in this respect.

\begin{equation}
    \widehat{A T T}_{d r}(g, t)=\mathbb{E}_n\left[\left(\widehat{w}_g^{\text{treat}}-\widehat{w}_g^{\text{comp}}\right)\left(Y_t-Y_{g-1}-\widehat{m}_{g, t}\left(X; \widehat{\beta}_{g, t}\right)\right)\right],
    \label{eq:attdr}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}[t]
        \widehat{w}_g^{\text {treat }}=\frac{G_g}{\mathbb{E}_n\left[G_g\right]},
    \end{aligned}\qquad
    \begin{aligned}[t]
        \widehat{w}_g^{\text{comp}}=\frac{\frac{\widehat{p}_g\left(X ; \widehat{\pi}_g\right) C}{1-\widehat{p}_g\left(X ; \widehat{\pi}_g\right)}}{\mathbb{E}_n\left[\frac{\widehat{p}_g\left(X ; \widehat{\pi}_g\right) C}{1-\widehat{p}_g\left(X ; \widehat{\pi}_g\right)}\right]}
        \label{eq:wgtreatcomp}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\section{TWFE Alternative Design}
\label{app:twfe}

In the following, I present the alternative model featuring a TWFE regression design. 

\begin{equation}
    Y_{i,t}=\sum_{e \in \mathcal{E}} \theta_e^{\text{\tiny{FE}}}   \mathbb{1}(\text {health degradation})_{i,t}+ \eta  X_{i,t} + \delta_i + \gamma_t + u_{i,t},
    \label{eq:twfe}
\end{equation}
where the relatvei event times $e \in \mathcal{E} = \{-10, -8, -6, -4, 0, 2, ..., 12\}$. Note that
relative event time $e=-2$ is dropped from the estimation, in order to be able to identify the ATT
in a full set of individual and year fixed effects. The indicator function $\mathbb{1}(\text {health
    degradation})_{i,t}$ tracks the relative time since/until experiencing a significant health
degradation. The vector $X$ incorporates (time varying) covariates used in the model, and $\delta_i$
and $\gamma_t$ represent the individual and year fixed effects, respectively.

\section{Transformation of Log-Linear Specifications}
\label{sec:transformcoefs}

As explained in \code{estout}'s manual (\cite{jann2007making}),
a function, $f(b)$, and its first derivative, $\partial f(b)$, can be used to transform the coefficients to
be presented. Concretely, the following functions were used for the log specifications:  
%
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        f(b) = 100 \cdot (e^{b}-1), 
    \end{aligned}\qquad
    \begin{aligned}
        \partial f(b) = 100 \cdot (e^{b}).
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:transformcoefs}
\end{equation}

According to the package's manual, the first derivative is used to transform the standard errors as in:
\begin{equation}
        \text{se} \cdot \partial f(b)
\end{equation}

With regards to the log of \textit{net} wealth, however, the original coefficients cannot be interpreted as
percentage changes due to crossing over from negative to positive and vice-versa. To illustrate, if an
individual's net worth is valued at negative $10.000$€, and in the next period it is valued at positive
$20.000$€. What would the percentage change in their net wealth? Only if one assumes very few people cross the
€0 threshold could one interpret the coefficients approximately as a percentage change. As a matter of fact,
even the interpretation of gross wealth is not, at first, trivial due to the possibility of owning 0 wealth.
This issue is, however, circumvented with the unproblematic assumption that everyone has something valued for
at least $1$€. On these accounts, the transformation was applied to both gross and net wealth specifications,
but the reader should be aware of this caveat when interpreting the results of the neglog transformation.

\section{Health Scales and Sub-Scales Over the Life Cycle}

    \caption{Comparison of average health summary scores and sub-scales by age group}\label{fig:bothagesubscales}
    \fnote{Notes: This figure shows the sub-scales superimposed with the summary scores constructed following the 
        SF-12 method as well as the alternative method with an oblique rotation. Since age is a key variable that
        captures most of the variation in health outcomes, this visualization helps us better grasp 
        how the summary scores behave relative to each sub-scale. Note that \textit{Mental Health} is the
        denomination of one of the sub-scales, while MCS is the summary score in the mental domain. 
        }
        { \small \vspace*{6pt}
        Panel \subref{fig:pcsagesubscales} shows the PCS (from both methodologies) and the sub-scales from the physical health dimension. 
        It becomes apparent that in this domain, the summary scores are coherent with all sub-scales in both methodologies. 
        \\ In the Mental domain, depicted in panel \subref{fig:mcsagesubscales}, one sub-scale (Mental Health) shows a different pattern to the other three. 
        MCS\tsub{sf21} follows this single variable very closely, in detriment of the other three. 
        \\ It is worth noting that the interpretation of how the mental health unfolds over the life cycle differs considerably over the two methods. 
        MCS\tsub{sf21} would suggest a rather low starting point, then a slow increase over the time, a big increase around retirement age and, finally, a rapid decrease subsequently. 
        In the oblique case, in contrast, we see a relatively high starting point, then a slow decrease over time, then only a moderate increase around retirement and, finally, also a rapid decrease later on.
