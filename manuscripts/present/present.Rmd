## Motivation 

- Better health outcome is correlated with higher socioeconomic status (SES)

- Economic literature on topic relatively sparse due to intrinsic endogeneity of the problem

- SOEP provides rich information on several areas including health, wealth, income, lifestyle
that allows for very granular examination on possible mechanisms

- Deaton (2003) exposes a few hypotheses
  - Education: with access to better education -> better health
decisions
  - Irrationality: Too high discount rate -> failure to build capital
& protect health
  - Absolute vs relative “income hypothesis” -> not only level of wealth but also
  ranking, i.e, inequality, affect health outcomes

## Data 

- Cross-sectional SOEPv36 data from 2019 with 24.429 observations including new sample on
top-stakeholders (TS)

- Wealth module from 2017 for other samples

- INKAR data for geographic healthcare provision on district level (Landkreis) 

- Item non-response imputed via Bayesian Networks as proposed by Göbler (2019)

- Drawback: Health module (from 2018/2020) with broader coverage of health variables not yet available
for SOEP TS sample 

## Health Data 

48 health related variables such as: 

- Did you feel _(x)_ in the last 2 weeks?
  - Lack of interests, Depressiveness, Nervousness, etc
- Has a doctor ever diagnosed you with _(x)_ ? 
  - Diabetes, Asthma, Cardiopathy, Cancer, Apoplectic Stroke, Migraine, etc
- How many days did you not work due to illness in the previous year? 
- Number of hospital stays in previous year? 
- Health insurance provider, and many more

## Wealth Percentiles


|   | 25th| 50th| 75th| 90th | 95th | 100th |
|---|  --:|  --:|  --:|   --:|   --:|    --:|
Net | 0,5 | 25,6 | 170 | 450 | 870 | 130M
Gross | 3,5 | 49,9 | 225 | 530 | 1,0M | 130M | 
Table: Percentile cuts of Wealth variables (_in thousand €_)



- Problematic to look at lower end of distribution looking only at wealth dimension
- Some distortion due to individuals with high socioeconomic status but vast amount of debt

## INKAR Indicators {.allowframebreaks} 

- Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung im Bundesamt für Bauwesen und Raumordnung (BBSR Bonn) 
provides through INKAR (Inkdikatoren und Karten zur Raum- und Stadtentwicklung) regional indicators on 
several variables including healthcare provision. 

- Healthcare provision displays regional heterogeneity that might play a role in health outcomes. 

- Note: INKAR Data note yet merged with SOEP data

## Outlook 

### Objectives

- Generate via Principal Components a physical, a mental and (possibly) a _social health_ variables
to consolidate available health information in fewer dimensions

- Investigate which variables more strongly predict health outcomes in these dimensions

- investigate how predictive are the physical and mental health variables on income and wealth
outcomes. 

### Challenges 

- Find a methodology that properly deal with endogeneity, confounder and collider biases 
(even if not aiming to infer causality)
- Still need to consolidate and focus on a overall research question.

External validation of health variables: Compare pop shares in SOEP with a certain disease and external admin statistics11:23
good point: Say, a diagnosis has been detected, how does health (life) satisfaction evolve over time for differnt wealth groups...11:29
