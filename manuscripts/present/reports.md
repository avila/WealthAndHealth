### quick feedback:

- concrete diseases only **after 2009** (every 2nd year, odd years)
   - Question as "Have you ever been diagnosed with ?"
      - -> asthma, cardiopathy, migrane, depression, stroke, etc.
      - variables ple0011-ple0024 from pl.dta
   - -> only overlaps with wealth module from **2012/17/19**
   - these variables have **basically no missing** due to item nonresponse, most missings presents are from M1-M5 and L1-L3 samples (They dont get these questions after 2015)
   - remaining variables are more broad/general, on the lines of:
      - nr of sick days last year,
      - doctor visits last year
      - days/nights in hospital last year
      - health satisfaction, life satisfaction,
      - days of leave due to sickness
      - etc



## discussion on 21 July w/ Johannes

J: would go into 2011, look at people that have not yet been diagnosed. 

- -> sample at risk as baseline

- track over time 17, 19)

- duration. 
  
   - wealth in 2012 until 2015. Â 

- 

- stephen jenkings, duration analysis: sample at risk

- -> 

- transition matrix. 

- 

grp on wealth, deciles, binary, disease, 



**So the question would be:**

- a) maintain panel structure with 3 data points? (7 years range)

- b) or focus on less concrete diagnoses such as "been to hospital", "x days in hospitals", etc? for whoe range 2002 - 2019

- c) or focus cross-section and dive down more deeply in each corner
  
   - by ""dive down"" I mean keeping the scope less broad but analysising the associations more deeeply, looking more granularly at the weatlh distribution, and bringing more control variables (labour market vars, biography vars, and so on).





go into 2011. people at risk, changes over time ,

## Questions:

1) deal with panel attrition:
   
    1) keep only observations valid on all years (odd years 2011 - 2019)?
       
        1) **8,803** observations on all above years
       
        2) samples(1 to 9 and 12)
   
    2) keep other observations as control only?
