## Preliminary results {.allowframebreaks}

Pooled OLS: 

- y: life / health satisfaction (scale 0 - 10)
- wealth: net wealth (interpolated)
- controls: age, education, gender, marital status, legally hadicapped, 


![Preliminary results (pooled ols)](../output/figures/explorative/regs/fig_margins_wealth_dcile_by_age_healthsats.png)


- wealth has higher predictive power at higher age. 
- unexpected non-linearity for lowest decile at higher ages (it could be highly leveraged pushing it)

## Issues 

- The fixed effects (or random) estimation is not converging. I believe is due to the fact that 
that there is little variation within-indiviual, since the majority of my control variables 
are categorical and wealth percentile is very stable in this short time frame.

## Ideas 

- check if there is enough observations with a big drop (or increase) in wealth in this time period
