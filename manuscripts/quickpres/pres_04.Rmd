# Recap


## Structure 

1. (Re)Constructing mcs and pcs from factor model of _subjective health measures_
     1. Discussion on differences between SOEP's and my factor model
1. Validating MCS and PCS (based on other more _objective_ variables)
1. Estimation of longitudinal clusters (GBTM) 
1. Main analysis: How does (mental/physical) health affect wealth build up
     1. Implement a matching method? 
     1. Implement a "event study" with dichotomized treatment as in "Out for good"?
1. Optional: detailed descriptives of health outcome across the wealth distribution (also over the life cycle)

## Health scores by trajectory group I: mcs and pcs

- Indication of _survivorship bias_ kicking in at around age 60 in cluster 1 for both variables
- Indication of (relatively small) starting differences which increase over the life cycle

## Health scores by trajectory group: mcs and pcs variation

- Using variation of health components as a measure of _health shock_
    - Alternatively: use the presence of a low health score as a shock. @vilagut2013 estimate optimal cut-off points
for depressive disorder detection. (45.6 for 30-day and  48.9 for 12-months depressive disorder. 
- Note that the health scores are shifted standard scores with mean=50 and sd=10 


## Validating $mcs$ and $sd(mcs)$

- Binscatter logit estimation adjusted for cubic splines of $age$ (Note: variable y scales)

- good indication that mental and physical score components are valid measures of _objective_ health outcomes
- also good indication that the variation of the above components are a good proxy for a measure of "health shock"
- the variation in $mcs$ seems more predictive than the variation in $pcs$


## Validating $mcs$, $sd(mcs)$, $pcs$ and $sd(pcs)$: Days off sick and hospitalization

- Binscatter linear regression adjusted for cubic splines of $age$ (Note: variable y scales)

# Main model 

## Choices: model specification 


### a: on the model specification choice 


$$
\tag{1: Residualized change model}
\label{eq:regressor}
W_2 = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 T + \gamma W_1 + ... + \epsilon
$$
$$
\tag{2: Change scores method}
\label{eq:delta}
\Delta W = W_2 - W_1 = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 T + ... + \epsilon
$$

\pause

- The **Lord's paradox** @lord1967 raises the issue of when it is appropriate to control for baseline (or starting conditions) status

- Paul @allison1990 defends the _change scores method_, which he calls _"the underdog"_ at the time, but when
expected that $W_1 \xrightarrow{\text{causal}} W_2$, then the _regressor variable approach_  is better
indicated (see ibid, pg 110). 

- Note that the _change scores method_ is a restricted form of the _residualized change model_, with $\gamma$ fixed to $1$.


<!-- ## Choices: transfomartion  -->

<!-- ### b: on the transformation choice -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!--   g(W_2)- g(W_1) -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!--   g(W_2 - W_1) -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->


<!-- - Possible transformations: identity, neglog, asinh, cubic root, percentile rank, etc. -->
<!-- - Question: what does the choice between (1) and (2) would change, a priori? -->

## Regression design 

$$
g({W_{i|age \approx 32}}) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 hs^{mean}_{i|age \in [21..30]} + \alpha_2 hs^{sd}_{i|age \in [21..30]} +
\gamma W_{i|age \approx 22} + \bm{{\beta X_{i}}} + \epsilon_{i}
$$
$$
g({W_{i|age \approx 42}}) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 hs^{mean}_{i|age \in [31..40]} + \alpha_2 hs^{sd}_{i|age \in [31..40]} +
\gamma W_{i|age \approx 32} + \bm{{\beta X_{i}}} + \epsilon_{i}
$$
$$
... \text{ and so on } ...
$$

\pause

- I can also do a single model with a relative period, but with separate models one can also check for differences 
in coeffecients over the life cycle.
- $g()$ is the cubic root here, but other transformations available (asinh, neglog, 5th root, etc)
- $hs$ stands for _health score_. For simplicity only one is displayed, but both components would be included in actual regression.


## Currently working on

- Good and bad controls
    - e.g. should (HH) income be included in regression model??
- Some proxy for parental or genectic influence
- Distance matching or weighting (with continuous treatment?)
- Construct balanced panel (only those with at least $x$ years presence?)
- Dealing with panel attrition (likely correlated with low health scores)
- Implement a "event study" with dichotomized treatment similar to strategy in "Out for good"?
- Validating methods by looking at the impact in other (more volatile) variables
    - Such as income, intensive/extensive labor market participation, etc
