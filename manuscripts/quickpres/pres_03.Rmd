# Overview 

## Thesis structure 


- Intro
- (Re)Constructing mcs and pcs from factor model of _subjective health measures_
     - Discussion on differences between SOEP's and my factor model
- Validating MCS and PCS (based on other more _objective_ variables)
- Estimation of longitudinal clusters (GBTM) 
- Main analysis: How does (mental/physical) health affect wealth build up
     - Implement a matching method? 
     - Implement a "event study" as in "out for good"?
- Optional: detailed descriptives of health outcome across the wealth distribution (also over the life cycle)

## Longitudinal Clusters

::: notes 
- 4 groups. 
- starting conditions in terms of wealth is very similar for the 3 groups

## health scores by trajectory group I: mcs and pcs

- Indication of survivorship bias kicking in at around age 60 in cluster 1 for both variables
- Indication of (small) starting differences, and increase over the life cycle

## health scores by trajectory group: mcs and pcs variation

- Using variation of health components as a measure of _health shock_

## Research question 

1. Whether mental and physical health impacts wealth build-up in a relatively long term (8 to 10 years intervals). 
1. Whether a high variation in mental and physical health impacts wealth build-up.
1. How do mental and physical health differs across wealth distribution over the life cycle.


## Choices: model specification 


### a: on the model specification choice 

\begin{equation}
  \tag{1: Residualized change model}
  \label{eq:regressor}
  W_2 = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 T + \beta W_1 + ... + \epsilon
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \tag{2: Change scores method}
  \label{eq:delta}
  \Delta W = W_2 - W_1 = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 T + ... + \epsilon
\end{equation}

\pause

- The **Lord's paradox** @lord1967 raises the issue of when it is appropriate to control for baseline (or starting conditions) status

- Paul @allison1990 defends the _change scores method_, which he calls _"the underdog"_ at the time, but when
expected that $W_1 \xrightarrow{\text{causal}} W_2$, then the _regressor variable approach_  is better
indicated (see ibid, pg 110). 

- Note that the _change scores method_ is a restricted form of the _residualized change model_, with $\beta$ fixed to $1$.


## Choices: transfomartion 

### b: on the transformation choice

\begin{equation}
  g(W_2)- g(W_1)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  g(W_2 - W_1)
\end{equation}


- Possible transformations: identity, neglog, asinh, cubic root, percentile rank, etc.
- Question: what does the choice between (1) and (2) would change, a priori?
- To use net wealth or gross wealth? 

## Regression design 

$$
g({W_{i|age=32}}) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 hs^{mean}_{i|age \in [21..30]} + \alpha_2 hs^{sd}_{i|age \in [21..30]} +
\beta W_{i|age=20} + \bm{\alpha X_{i}} + \epsilon_{i}
$$
$$
g({W_{i|age=42}}) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 hs^{mean}_{i|age \in [31..40]} + \alpha_2 hs^{sd}_{i|age \in [31..40]} +
\beta W_{i|age=30} + \bm{\beta X_{i}} + \epsilon_{i}
$$
$$
... \text{ and so on } ...
$$

- I can also do a single model with a relative period, but with separate models one can also check for differences 
in coeffecients over the life cycle.
- $g()$ is the cubic root here, but other transformations available (asinh, neglog, 5th root, etc)
- $hs$ stands for _health score_. For simplicity only one is displayed, but both components are included in actual regression.
- $W$ is currently Net Wealth, but gross wealth also available (and easier to model).


## Open questions or "To do's"

- \alert<1>{Bad (and good) controls}
- \alert<2>{Some generational control (parents education?)}
- \alert<3>{Distance matching or weighting (with continuous treatment?)}
- \alert<4>{Construct balanced panel (only those with at least $x$ years presence?)}
- \alert<5>{How to deal with panel attrition (a priori: lower health scores correlates with attrition, specially later in life)}

::: notes 
- Bad control: should (HH) income be considered a control variable?
