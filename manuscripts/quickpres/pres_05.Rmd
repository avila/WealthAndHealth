# Recap


## Structure

1. _Descriptives_ of health outcome across the wealth distribution over the life cycle
1. (Re)Constructing mcs and pcs from factor model of _subjective health measures_
    1. Discussion on differences between SOEP's and alternative health scores
    1. Validating MCS and PCS as a measure of mental and physical health.
1. Main analysis: How does physical and mental health outcome affect wealth trajectory in a relatively long term?
    1. Main model: Diff-in-Diff with staggered treatment
    1. Secondary model: Lagged dependent variable
1. Panel Attrition based on health and wealth outcomes


## PCS and MCS: Should we really use them? 


- Although measures are predictive of disease diagnoses (depression, high blood pressure, etc), 
MCS and PCS (as constructed in @ware1995how) is not particularly robust, both theoretically and empirically:
  - Mental _input_ variables affect physical scores and vice-versa, resulting in an artifact at the 
  extremes of the distribution, due to negative score coefficients.
  - Principal components imply orthogonalily among scores, i.e. no correlation between mental and physical
  components, thus exacerbating this issue.
  - Scores obtained after oblique rotation ameliorate the issue
  - Scores obtained from separate factor models, one for mental, one for physical might be a good alternative


## Artifacts generated by the default SF12 factor extraction method? I

## Artifacts generated by the default SF12 factor extraction method? II


- All methods show a small but clear increase in mental health between 60 and 67 years 
- Based on **default SF12** method, one would interpret an increase in mental health over the lifetime for
more educated people and a somewhat constant for the less educated
- The **alternative method** shows the reverse: somewhat constant for the more educated but a clear decrease 
for the less educated. 
- The **row average** scores shows a similar picture as the _alternative method_


I argue that the default method result is an artifact from the orthogonal rotation used when estimating
the health components scores. 

  
## PCS and MCS: Default sf12 method

![](../../output/figures/validatingmcspcs/comb_def_hd_depression_ever.pdf){width=60%}

- binscatter from depression on PCS and MCS

## PCS and MCS: Simple average of input variables

![](../../output/figures/validatingmcspcs/comb_rmean_hd_depression_ever.pdf){width=60%}

- Simple average does not display "artifacts" at extremes
- Note: small random noise added to health scores to be able to estimate confidence intervals

## PCS and MCS: Main alternative (oblique rotation)

![](../../output/figures/validatingmcspcs/comb_main_hd_depression_ever.pdf){width=60%}

- Better, but not perfect. Artifact concentrated at the very extreme only. 

## PCS and MCS: Separated factors for each domain

![](../../output/figures/validatingmcspcs/comb_sep_hd_depression_ever.pdf){width=60%}

- Maybe even better than main alternative method

# Main model 


## DiD with multiple time periods and variation in treatment timing 

Following the notation from @roth2023trending, 
$$
 (Eq. 1) ~~~  Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \sum_{r \neq 0} \mathbbm{1} [R_{i,t}=r]\beta_r + \epsilon_{i,t}
$$

where $r$ is the _relative_ time of treatment $t$ is bi-yearly time index and $i$ the individual index. 
The _treatment_ is dichotomized from a significant difference (1 std. dev or $\frac{1}{2}$ std. dev) from 
the average health outcome of people of same age and sex. 

- Notes: 
  - @borusyaketal2022revisiting show that Eq. 1 only valid under treatment effect homogeneity (including dynamic), 
  so I compare with and follow @cs2021did_mtp estimation, which allows for "arbitrary treatment effect heterogeneity"

# Lagged dependent variable model

## Lagged dependent variable model 


$$
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:regressor}
W_{t=0} & = \alpha_1 + \gamma_{0} f(H) + \alpha_2 W_{t=-1} +  X\beta +    \epsilon \\
W_{t=1} & = \alpha_1 + \gamma_{1} f(H) + \alpha_2 W_{t=-1} +  X\beta +    \epsilon \\
W_{t=2} & = \alpha_1 + \gamma_{2} f(H) + \alpha_2 W_{t=-1} +  X\beta +    \epsilon \\
& ... \\\
W_{t=6} & = \alpha_1 + \gamma_{6} f(H) + \alpha_2 W_{t=-1} +  X\beta +    \epsilon 
\end{aligned}
$$

- bi-yearly data, so $t=6$, it is 12 years in the future
- Four separate models for each health component: pcs, mcs, sd(pcs) and sd(mcs)
- $f(H)$ is defined as the mean or standard deviation in $H$ in $syear_{t \in (-k, ... , 0)}$
- Separate models for age sub-groups

# Results 


## Results I

![](../../output/figures/coefplot/regress_cov_gcmu_nw_nlog_age_g1.pdf){width=80%}

## Results II


- In this specification, the health variables are continuous. 
- Although PCS is the first factor and accounts for most of the variation in factor space, MCS and sd(MCS)
is also able to capture some effect on the trajectory of net wealth.

- Using _neglog_ of net wealth, [$\textrm{sign}(W) \cdot \log(1 + abs(W))$], the coefficient is no longer 
interpretable as an elasticity due to values changing from positive to negative and vice versa. 

## Panel attrition and specification considerations

- Assuming a priori that
$H \rightarrow W$ is positive, then the attrition of low-health / low-wealth people attenuates the estimated coefficient towards zero. 

- Bracketing Relationship: "if the parallel trends assumption is correct, then mistakenly assuming ignorability will underestimate the effect" (@ding2019bracketing).


## Other considerations?

- Reverse causality (care on the interpretation)
  - Strong ignorability or unconfoundness, meaning  "treatment is independent of potential outcomes conditional on X".
- Very big negative wealth values: Individuals with high Socioesconomic status (SES) on both extremes of wealth distribution
  - Critic on wealth as a single SES dimension 
  - In some specifications, results are more precise if I drop the lowest netwealth decile, for example.

## Panel Attrition IV

- Although less visible, Cox-Proportional-Hazard models results in significant effects on attrition 
for PCS and MCS (in levels). Their variation counterparts are insignificant. 

Hazard ratio and z-stat in parenthesis:

- pcs:  .8859451       (-3.12)
- mcs:  .9157573       (-2.64)
- nw_nlog: .9816596    (-6.94)
- interpretation:
    - 1 unit std. dev. higher in mcs or pcs is associated with around 10% lower risk of dropping out
    - 1% increase in net wealth associated with around 2% lower risk of dropping out
